# Semantic Kernel Plugins

Plugins are at the heart of unlocking more potential with your Semantic Kernel applications.
They allow you to connect to external data sources and give large language models tools to be able to
interact with native functions and API services.

# Want to test your plugins? ‚öóÔ∏è

If you want to try out your plugins and you do not have a ChatGPT plus subscription or are off the waitlist, you can test this directly using the Semantic Kernel!

See [this tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/ai-orchestration/chatgpt-plugins) for how to do get set up.
